About The Dubai Life

Welcome to TheDubaiLife! I’m Dary, a healthcare professional navigating life in one of the world’s most dynamic cities, Dubai. Having relocated from Southeast Asia to work in the health department, I’ve been on a journey of both professional growth and personal exploration.

This blog is where I share my experiences of living in Dubai, from the challenges of adapting to a new culture to the fascinating aspects of the city’s healthcare system. Whether you're curious about what it’s like to work in healthcare here, tips for expatriates, or insights into Dubai’s lifestyle and attractions, you’ll find it all in my posts.

Through TheDubaiLife, I hope to connect with other expats, healthcare professionals, and anyone interested in learning more about life in Dubai. Join me as I share my story, from work-life balance tips to exploring the diverse and exciting aspects of this city.
