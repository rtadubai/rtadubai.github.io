Hey there, fellow shawarma lover! Let me share some local favorites that'll make your taste buds dance. Forget the tourist spots - these are the real deals where locals queue up for their shawarma fix.

## In Dubai:

- **Belad Al Sham** in Qusais is the king of meat shawarma. Trust me, it's worth the drive.
- **Chicken Maestro** near Al Qiyadah metro station never disappoints. They've mastered consistency.
- Looking for something different? Try **Layali Warood Alsham** in Abu Hail - their meat shawarma in saj bread is a game-changer.

## In Abu Dhabi:
- **Bait El Khetyar** is the local favorite. When Abu Dhabi folks talk shawarma, this place always comes up.

## Local Secrets:
- **Ghazal Al Madeena** near Aweer Fruits Market keeps it simple - chicken + thick garlic sauce in saj bread. Sometimes simple is perfect.
- **Shiraz Nights** in Baniyas, Deira serves up a mean chicken shawarma in saj bread.
- **Al Mallah** in Satwa (can't believe people almost forgot this gem!)
- Want Iranian style? Head to **Caspian**.

## Pro Tip:
- **Al Baalbaki** in Al Furjan is super reliable. Great for late-night cravings.

## Online Secret:
- **Malak Al Shawarma** on Noon Food - their meat shawarma in saj bread is worth ordering.

## Quick Heads-up:
Best to call ahead for opening hours, as some of these spots can get super busy during peak times. Also, prices are wallet-friendly, usually ranging from 7-15 AED per shawarma.
